## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Risk 1: Backend Development Takes Longer
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Start backend work immediately (Day 1)
- Daily standups to catch blockers early
- Have frontend mock APIs for parallel development
- Consider using sample data for frontend testing

**Contingency:**
- Push launch by 1 week if needed
- Ship with upload only, add streaming in v0.1.1

---

### Risk 2: AgentPipe Bridge Delays Frontend Testing
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Provide detailed bridge spec upfront
- Create mock bridge for frontend testing
- Set up test events that frontend can use
- AgentPipe team starts immediately (Day 1)

**Contingency:**
- Frontend uses mock events for development
- Integration testing happens in Week 2-3
- Launch with known users who have bridge

---

### Risk 3: Poor Performance at Scale
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Performance testing with large datasets (Week 5)
- Database query optimization
- Implement caching early
- Monitor metrics in production

**Contingency:**
- Add database indexes post-launch
- Implement pagination more aggressively
- Add Redis caching layer

---

### Risk 4: Low User Adoption
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Excellent setup experience (one-click key generation)
- Clear value proposition in empty states
- Demo video showing benefits
- User interviews to understand barriers

**Contingency:**
- Iterate quickly on setup flow
- Add CLI setup command to automate config
- Offer hosted version to reduce friction

---
